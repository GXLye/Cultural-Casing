Cultural Casing


Problem Statement: 
Malaysia tourism has always played a significant role in contributing the ecnomical growth of the nation. 
Thus, the government has spent huge amount of money to boost up the industry. 
Creating a casing of USB flash drive is a straightforward, econmical and creative promotional medium to globalize Malaysian culture to the world. 
This will improve and expand the tourism industry of Malaysia when they use the casing, since it is now common to own this piece of "walking-memory" in all walks of life. 
Apart from that, a mobile app has developed to allow users to personalize their own favorite designs.
